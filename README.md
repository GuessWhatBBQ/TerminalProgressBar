# TerminalProgressBar

This is a simple script that adds a progress bar and updates it as commands are completed sequentially in an array. Any output from the commands are redirected to a file called progressbar.log which can be found in the folder where the script was executed from.

## Usage
Simply modify the array at the top of the file. An example has been included and any meaningful work to be done using the script should remove the example commands. An optional `-i` flag can be passed to make the script continue regardless of any errors from the execution of any of the commands.
